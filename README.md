## Libraries Used

#### EZSwiftExtensions
* Description: A collection of useful extensions for the Swift Standard Library, Foundation, and UIKit.
* Justification: I use EZSwiftExtensions in every single project I work on because it allows me to code faster with amazing extensions like ```UIImageView.roundSquareImage` or ```Date.fromString("", format: "")```. It has a CocoaPods Quality index of 96(which is pretty high), with several tests, ensuring the library is stable
